    "The `Pipe` class models the flow of water through a pipe, connecting two points in a water system. The model uses the Darcy-Weisbach equation to calculate flow based on the pressure difference (head) between its ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can operate in two modes:\n",
    "1. **Gravity Flow**: If no inflow is specified, the flow is calculated based on the `upstream_head` and `downstream_head` provided in the `action`.\n",
    "2. **Forced Flow**: If an inflow is set (e.g., by an upstream pump), that inflow is treated as the pipe's outflow, and the model instead calculates the resulting head loss."
