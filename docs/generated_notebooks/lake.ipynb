    "The `Lake` class models a lake or reservoir with a fixed surface area. It's a stateful object, meaning its state (primarily its volume) evolves over time based on inflows and outflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model accounts for:\n",
    "- **Inflow**: Water entering the lake from upstream sources.\n",
    "- **Outflow**: Water being drawn from the lake by a downstream component (like a turbine or gate).\n",
    "- **Evaporation**: Water lost from the surface, calculated from an evaporation rate."

    "- `volume` (float): The current volume of water in the lake (m^3).\n",
    "- `water_level` (float): The current water level (m), calculated from volume and surface area.\n",
    "- `outflow` (float): The outflow from the lake for the current step (m^3/s). This is not calculated by the lake itself, but is provided as an input to its `step` method.\n",

    "- `max_volume` (float): The maximum storage capacity of the lake (m^3).\n",
