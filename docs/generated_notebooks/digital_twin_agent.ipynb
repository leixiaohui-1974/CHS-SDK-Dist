    "# Agent Component: Digital Twin Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DigitalTwinAgent` is a type of **Perception Agent**. Its sole responsibility is to act as a digital counterpart to a physical object in the simulation. It reads the state of its associated physical object and publishes that state to the `MessageBus`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulates the role of a sensor in a real-world system, providing a stream of data that other agents can subscribe and react to. This is a fundamental component for creating a decoupled, event-driven multi-agent system."

    "In the simulation below, we will:\n",
    "1. Create a `Reservoir` as our physical object.\n",
    "2. Create a `DigitalTwinAgent` and link it to the reservoir.\n",
    "3. Create a simple `listener` function that subscribes to the agent's topic on the `MessageBus` and records all messages it receives.\n",
    "4. In a loop, we will manually change the reservoir's volume and then call the agent's `run()` method.\n",
    "5. Finally, we will inspect the messages captured by our listener to verify that the agent correctly published the state changes."
