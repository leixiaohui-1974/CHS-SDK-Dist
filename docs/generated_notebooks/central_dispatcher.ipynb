    "# Agent Component: Central Dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CentralDispatcher` is a high-level coordinating agent. It sits above local controllers and implements a system-wide strategy. It works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subscribing** to multiple state topics from across the system to build a global view of the situation.\n",
    "2. **Evaluating** a set of rules or a strategy based on this global view.\n",
    "3. **Publishing** high-level commands (like new setpoints) to local control agents to change their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent has a hybrid execution model:\n",
    "- Its knowledge of the system state is updated in a purely **event-driven** way via message subscriptions.\n",
    "- Its decision-making logic is executed in its `run()` method, which is called periodically by the simulation harness. This is a **time-stepped** model."

    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate the dispatcher's rule-based logic. We will configure it with a rule to issue a 'flood alert' command if a reservoir's water level goes above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will create a `CentralDispatcher` with this rule.\n",
    "2. We will set up a listener to capture any commands it sends.\n",
    "3. We will first run the agent with a normal water level.\n",
    "4. Then, we will publish a high water level to the state topic and run the agent again. This should trigger the rule and cause a command to be published."
